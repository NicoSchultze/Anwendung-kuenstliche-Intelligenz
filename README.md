# "Anwendung k√ºnstlicher Intelligenz"

### To train the network, the following libraries need to be installed:

torch, 
numpy, 
os, 
random, 
Image, 
torchvision, 
matplotlib, 
collections, 

It is also recommended to have Cuda installed on your system, so that you can train the network more efficiently.

Please import the the folders images_background and images_evaluation from: https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot

Copy those folders in the data folder of this project.

These are the sources I have used to implement the network, dataclasses and to get an overall understanding of the paper.
